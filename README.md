# Hospital-Data-Management-Dashboard
Project Objective:
To analyze and visualize patient data across five key departments (Oncology, Pediatrics, Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopedics) from January 1 to December 31, 2023. The goal is to identify trends in demographics, admission volume, and patient status to inform resource management and strategic decision-making.
# Data Analysis Process
Data Collection: Acquired patient records (department, age, gender, status, admission date) for 10,000 patient IDs.
Data Transformation: Calculated total counts, percentages, and monthly aggregates for the hospital and specific departments.
Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards to visualize:
Overall patient load and gender distribution.
Department-specific breakdowns by gender, age group, and patient status.
Monthly patient admission trends.
Interpretation: Extracted insights regarding peak admissions, highest volume departments, and demographic patterns.
# Question (KPI'S)
1.What was the total patient volume recorded for the entire period (01-01-2023 to 31-12-2023)?
2.Which department has the highest total patient load, and what is its count?
3.What is the overall gender distribution of patients, and which gender group is the largest across most departments?
4.Which age group (e.g., 11-20, 51-60) accounts for the highest number of admissions hospital-wide?
5.Which month had the highest overall patient admissions (peak season)?
6.Which month recorded the lowest overall patient admissions (off-peak season)?
7.Which months experience the peak admission volumes for key departments like Cardiology, Oncology, and Orthopedics?
8.What is the distribution of patient status (Admitted, In Treatment, Discharged) in each department, and is there a balanced flow?
# Conclusion
The analysis highlights that Oncology and Pediatrics are the most resource-intensive departments. Admissions generally dip during the summer and surge in the fall (September/October), making these crucial months for staffing and resource preparedness across most specialties. The dominance of the 11-20 age group suggests a need for tailored resources and services focused on younger patients.
